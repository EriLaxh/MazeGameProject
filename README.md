* **Colourful Themes:** Vibrant textures and child-friendly designs.
* **Audio Integration:** Background music and sound effects enhance engagement.
* **Dynamic Scoring:** Tracks player progress through a move counter.
* **Customisation:** Enter your username for a personalised experience.

## Key Technologies

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Three.js (for 3D rendering)
